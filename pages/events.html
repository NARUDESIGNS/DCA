                    ministry gather to worship, pray and listen to the word of God. It is usually a season of intense
                    prays, miracles, signs and wonders. This intense spiritual exercise holds every year during the
                    Easter holidays from Thursday to Sunday. Many testimonies of the workings of God has come out of
                    these glorious meetings.</p>

                    midst of prayers. This worship and praise event holds every second Saturday in June. We have had

                    This is our holy ghost filled interdominational prayer service where people from far and near come
                    together to pray. The idea of this programme is depositing our prayers in a bank, just like you
                    would do at a commercial bank, so that we can harvest the testimonies and breakthroughs as
                    investments later on. This powerful event holds in the main church auditorium by 7am on the second
                    saturday in the months of February, July and November.
